Super User

 1. Super user have permissions less than any Administrator's permission and more than any guest user.
    Hence, Super user's permissions can be :
      --> Read, add, delete or
      --> Read, add, modify only.


 2. They cannot access control panel, to allow them access control panel --
      -->  Login with Root user's or Administrator's account
      -->  Go to control Panel, then General Settings 
      --> 'Enable' Access Control Panel setting
    Then, Super users also access control panel.


 3. Super user can add/remove user if they are allowed to access control panel.

 4. Super user's permission can be up/down graded to make this user an Administrator/Guest user.

 If Administrator/Root User allows any user to give them few permissions not all, Then this type of users are created.

 By Default after 'creating a new Account', New user is Super user with permission of Read and Add data only. To make this Guest/Administrator user --
      -->  Login with Root user's or Administrator's account
      -->  Go to control Panel, then 'Set Permissions'
      -->  Select newly created user by his username
      -->  At bottom of the screen, Give him full or few permissions by clicking on permission names
      -->  Then, click on 'Reset Permissions'.
      -->  Now this user is placed in list according to his provided permission.
