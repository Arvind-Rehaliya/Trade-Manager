Delete Permission

 Root user and Administrator can delete data of table.
 If any Super User have permission to 'Delete data', then he can also do so.
 But. Guest Users not in any way.


 Once Table's data is deleted, it cannot be reverted to back as it is permanently deleted.
 To recover that data backup should be created.
