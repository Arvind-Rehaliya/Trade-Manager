Read Permission

 In this permission every table's data is seen or can be read by users.
 If this permission is not given to any user then that user cannot see existing data of tables.

 Users having no any permission resides in 'Guest users list' with no any permission and all the permissions down below are unchecked.
 If he has permission to 'Add data', he can add data to every table. Without seeing the existing data.
 But, If he want to see existing table data he simply being a 'Guest user' as they have permission to Read and Add data (if allowed) permission only. Now this is a problem.


 Thus, to prevent this type of users to see existing data on table. Just set Password on this software. By --
      -->  Login with Root user's or Administrator's account
      -->  Go to control Panel, then General Settings 
      -->  After 'Enable' 'Security' set password.


 Now, every time user run this software he have to give correct Password to enter.
