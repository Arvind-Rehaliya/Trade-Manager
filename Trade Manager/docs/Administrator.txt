Administrator

 1. Administrator also have the full permissions to modify all tables and can access the control panel as well.

 2. Administrator can add/remove user.

 3. Administrator can be removed by Root user or by any existing Administrator.


 Any user can be a Administrator by giving him full permissions, by control panel. And control panel can access by Root user, Administrator and Super User (if they allowed to access) only.

 There should be least number of Administrators, as they also have full access they can modify whole tables structure and modify software configurations.

 So, making any user a Administrator, Root user or existing Administrator should be careful.

 Administrator's permission can be downgrade by users who can access control panel.
