Modify Permission

 Root user and Administrator can modify data of table.
 If any Super User have permission to 'Modify data', then he can also do so.
 But. Guest Users not in any way.


 Once Table's data is modified, it cannot be reverted to back as it is permanently modified.
 To recover that data backup should be created.
