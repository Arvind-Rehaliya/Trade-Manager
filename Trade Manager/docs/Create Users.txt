Create User

 New user can be created through login window by clicking 'Create new Account' button. 
 After clicking this button a new window will open enter correct details of this user then, click 'Create Account'. 
 This user is by default a Super User with permission of 'Read and Add Data'.

 To prevent unnecessary creation of users this button can be hide by --
    --> Go to General Settings in Control Panel after login
    --> 'Enable' 'Avoid User Creation from Login Page' option
    then, 'Create new Account' button will be hide.
 
 By default this option is 'Disabled'.
